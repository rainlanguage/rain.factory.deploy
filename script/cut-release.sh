# Freeze the rolling `candidate` snapshot as a numbered release snapshot, then
# regenerate the deploy pointer lib.
#
# Invoked by rainix-tag-release as its `snapshot-generate-cmd`, AFTER the
# reusable has resolved the release version from the pushed `sol-vX.Y.Z` tag and
# written it to `foundry.toml` `[package].version`. So the version is read from
# `foundry.toml` here — the single source of truth at this point.
#
# Model: `src/generated/candidate/` is the rolling snapshot of what the current
# source compiles to (regenerated every BuildPointers run). A numbered snapshot
# (`0_1_5/`, …) is a FROZEN copy of `candidate` taken at the instant a tag
# releases it — it never changes again (the frozen-snapshots-append-only gate
# enforces this). This script performs that copy, then re-runs BuildPointers so
# the pointer lib is regenerated on top of the freshly cut tree.
